You can do, its implementation for Index or Length based

Both the implementations, would look very similar to that of the
Generate_All_Possible_Codes_Return__Idx_Impl.py  and
Generate_All_Possible_Codes_Return__Len_Impl.py

The only difference, will be
1. We don't require to pass a list, to store the codes. (which we are adding in the base case)
2. Instead of adding the code, into the list just directly print it
3. We don't need to return the list, so remove the return statement
