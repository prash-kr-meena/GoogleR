 Number Line
initially we are at position 0

ith step => i units in either direction

                          0
1st:         1                    -1                          // 1 unit
2nd:   -1      3            -3        1                       // 2 units
3rd: -4  2   0  6       -6   0    -2    4                     // 3 units


total n ?             can be infinite as well

inf no not reachable


P to P+1
S, S+1, S+2

P (-S) (S+1) => P+1

P -> P-S -> P-S + S + 1 = P+1

any deterministic way where i can say i have reached the point?
we can go in either direction to get to the point


Q: What are the points which aren't reachable ever?
